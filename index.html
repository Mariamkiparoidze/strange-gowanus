	<p class="intro">Stretched across 1,8 miles in Brooklyn, New York surrounded by more calm neighborhoods like Park Slope and Cobble Hill, is the infamous Gowanus Canal. The Gowanus Canal was built in the 19th century and was a big part of industrial transportation routes. Over the centuries though, the industrial waste poured into the water along with sewage and it did not flow out.  "Water from the Upper New York Bay flowed in, but then just… stayed there,” Dan Nosowitz wrote in Popular Science.</p>

				<p class="intro">So the factories and other manufacturing sites around, coupled with sewage flow created a waterway that’s become notorious for being one of the most polluted and contaminated in the United States. In 2010 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared the Gowanus Canal a Superfund site. In 2020 EPA approved a $1.5 billion cleaning operation and in spite of environmental concerns the site has seen interest from developers. </p>

				<p class="intro">Over the centuries, the foul odor and contamination gained the canal many descriptions and nicknames such as “Perfume Creek,” for example.</p>

				<p class="intro">Some scientists believe there are unique organisms living there even though it’s full of toxic chemicals. It’s an unstudied site but there have been many interesting and fascinating events and findings in and around  the Gowanus that we’ve heard. Here are three from recent years.</p>

					<h3>The Whale</h3>

					<img src="images/whale.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">In 2007 people around the canal were fascinated by seeing a whale in the canal. The whale, minke, which is the second smallest whale species, became an object of admiration, The New York Times reported at the time. “Parents brought small children, whale watchers brought binoculars and photographers brought long lenses to the areas overlooking the canal.” After a couple days though, the whale mysteriously died.</figcaption>

				<h3>The Three-eyed fish</h3>

					<img src="images/new-fish.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text"> In 2015 another mystery around Gowanus made waves, when a publication Gothamist shared a video from a fisherman who declared he’d caught a three-eyed fish in the canal. “It was always only a matter of time until the putrid toxic waters of the Gowanus Canal spit out some mutant hellspawn determined to seek revenge on humanity for decades of non stop pollution,” the article said. However, after the three-eyed fish made headlines, scientists started sharing their observations that it was highly unlikely the fish actually had three eyes. “It looks like someone stuck a piece of paper on this [fish] to make it look like a third eye,” NYU biology professor Richard Borowsky, told The New York Post.

					<h3>Pride Paddle</h3>

					<img src="images/Rainbow.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Some people find rainbows in the murky, muddy and smelly waters of Gowanus. For the fourth year in a row, the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club has been hosting Pride Paddles, a canoeing event during Pride month in June. So, equipped with rainbow flags and life jackets, the canoers said they really enjoyed a mysterious and historic place and the distinctiveness of the event, much like the canal itself. The Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club has also been hosting art shows, readings and jam sessions around the canal.</figcaption>
